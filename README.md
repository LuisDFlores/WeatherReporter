# WeatherReporter

https://ourweathery.netlify.app/

A React application using Axios. Using the weather API , a user can input the name of any city and get the current weathehr. Jsx was used to handle the requests was styled with css customizations. 
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, JavaScript

This is a fullstack application built on the foundations of Node.js and JS. The templating language EJS was used and was styled with tailwind css and css customizations. Passport Js was used to authenticate. Express was used to handle the routes. The MVC model was implemented not only to optimize and edit faster, but to practice optimal coding conventions. Mongo DB alongside moongoose were used to store variables, sessions, logins and posts. 

## Optimizations

Have a temperature conversion button. Use city image api to incorporate where and what the city looks like. Add login and security interface.


## Other Works:
